abstract = {Among 233 children, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) DNA was detected in 43{\%} of children seropositive for both K8.1 and orf73, in 29{\%} of children seropositive for K8.1 only, in 14{\%} of children seropositive for orf73 only, and in 7{\%} of children seronegative for both K8.1 and orf73; among 228 mothers, KSHV DNA was detected in 27{\%}, 25{\%}, 4{\%}, and 1{\%}, respectively. KSHV DNA was detected more frequently and at higher levels in saliva than in buffy-coat samples and in children than in mothers. In both children and mothers, detection in saliva was associated with detection in peripheral blood. Detection was associated with K8.1 seropositivity, younger age, and high household density, indicating the importance of in-household person-to-person transmission, likely via saliva.},

abstract = {Efficient genetic modification of herpesviruses such as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has come to rely on bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) technology. In order to facilitate this approach, we generated a new KSHV BAC clone, called BAC16, derived from the rKSHV.219 virus, which stems from KSHV and Epstein-Barr virus-coinfected JSC1 primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cells. Restriction enzyme and complete sequencing data demonstrate that the KSHV of JSC1 PEL cells showed a minimal level of sequence variation across the entire viral genome compared to the complete genomic sequence of other KSHV strains. BAC16 not only stably propagated in both Escherichia coli and mammalian cells without apparent genetic rearrangements, but also was capable of robustly producing infectious virions (∼5 × 10(7)/ml). We also demonstrated the utility of BAC16 by generating deletion mutants of either the K3 or K5 genes, whose products are E3 ligases of the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) family. While previous studies have shown that individual expression of either K3 or K5 results in efficient downregulation of the surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules, we found that K5, but not K3, was the primary factor critical for the downregulation of MHC-I surface expression during KSHV lytic reactivation or following de novo infection. The data presented here demonstrate the utility of BAC16 for the generation and characterization of KSHV knockout and mutant recombinants and further emphasize the importance of functional analysis of viral genes in the context of the KSHV genome besides the study of individual gene expression.},

abstract = {Red recombination using PCR-amplified selectable markers is a well-established technique for mutagenesis of large DNA molecules in Escherichia coli. The system has limited efficacy and versatility, however, for markerless modifications including point mutations, deletions, and particularly insertions of longer sequences. Here we describe a procedure that combines Red recombination and cleavage with the homing endonuclease I-SceI to allow highly efficient, PCR-based DNA engineering without retention of unwanted foreign sequences. We applied the method to modification of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) constructs harboring an infectious herpesvirus clone to demonstrate the potential of the mutagenesis technique, which was used for the insertion of long sequences such as coding regions or promoters, introduction of point mutations, scarless deletions, and insertion of short sequences such as an epitope tag. The system proved to be highly reliable and efficient and can be adapted for a variety of different modifications of BAC clones, which are fundamental tools for applications as diverse as the generation of transgenic animals and the construction of gene therapy or vaccine vectors.},

abstract = {Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes the constitutively active G protein-coupled receptor ORF74, which is expressed on the surface of infected host cells and has been linked to the development of the angioproliferative tumor Kaposi's sarcoma. Furthermore, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase, also plays an essential role in Kaposi's sarcoma growth and survival.In this study we examined the effect of the constitutively active viral receptor ORF74 on human IGF-1R signaling. Constitutive and CXCL1-induced ORF74 signaling did not transactivate IGF-1R. In contrast, IGF-1 stimulated phospholipase C (PLC) activation in an ORF74-dependent manner without affecting chemokine binding to ORF74. Inhibition of constitutive ORF74 activity by mutagenesis or the inverse agonist CXCL10, or neutralizing IGF-1R with an antibody or silencing IGF-1R expression using siRNA inhibited PLC activation by IGF-1. Transactivation of ORF74 in response to IGF-1 occurred independently of Src, PI3K, and secreted ORF74 ligands. Furthermore, tyrosine residues in the carboxyl-terminus and intracellular loop 2 of ORF74 are not essential for IGF-1-induced PLC activation. Interestingly, PLC activation in response to IGF-1 is specific for ORF74 as IGF-1 was unable to activate PLC in cells expressing the constitutively active human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-encoded GPCR US28. Interestingly, IGF-1 does not induce $\beta$-arrestin recruitment to ORF74. The proximity ligation assay revealed close proximity between ORF74 and IGF-1R on the cell surface, but a physical interaction was not confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Unmasking IGF-1R signaling to PLC in response to IGF-1 is a previously unrecognized action of ORF74.},

abstract = {Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and at least two B cell lymphoproliferative diseases: primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). B cells derived from PEL are latently infected, and can be induced to lytic replication by treatment with chemical agents like TPA or butyrate, which have pleiotropic effects on host cell signaling and chromatin structure. Most of these lines also display moderate levels of spontaneous lytic induction, which complicates analysis of latency. Here we describe the creation of latently infected cell lines derived from SLK endothelial cells that (i) display tight control of KSHV latency, with little spontaneous reactivation and (ii) are efficiently inducible by doxycycline, avoiding the need for pleiotropic inducing agents. These cells produce substantial quantities of infectious KSHV, and should be useful for studies of the latent-lytic switch and the impact of lytic replication on host cell biology. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The entry of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) into human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-d), natural in vivo target cells, via macropinocytosis is initiated through a multistep process involving the binding of KSHV envelope glycoproteins with cell surface alpha 3 beta 1, alpha V beta 3, and alpha V beta 5 integrin molecules and tyrosine kinase ephrin-A2 receptor, followed by the activation of preexisting integrin-associated signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK), Src, c-Cbl, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K), and Rho-GTPases. Many viruses, including KSHV, utilize cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) for viral genomic replication and survival within host cells; however, the role of ROS in early events of viral entry and the induction of signaling has not been elucidated. Here we show that KSHV induced ROS production very early during the infection of HMVEC-d cells and that ROS production was sustained over the observation period (24 h postinfection). ROS induction was dependent on the binding of KSHV to the target cells, since pretreatment of the virus with heparin abolished ROS induction. Pretreatment of HMVEC-d cells with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly inhibited KSHV entry, and consequently gene expression, without affecting virus binding. In contrast, H2O2 treatment increased the levels of KSHV entry and infection. In addition, NAC inhibited KSHV infection-induced translocation of alpha V beta 3 integrin into lipid rafts, actin-dependent membrane perturbations, such as blebs, observed during macropinocytosis, and activation of the signal molecules ephrin-A2 receptor, FAK, Src, and Rac1. In contrast, H2O2 treatment increased the activation of ephrin-A2, FAK, Src, and Rac1. These studies demonstrate that KSHV infection induces ROS very early during infection to amplify the signaling pathways necessary for its efficient entry into HMVEC-d cells via macropinocytosis.},
